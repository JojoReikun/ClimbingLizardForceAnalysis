This python script is meant to work with the climbing lizard data split by family and group.
It needs the following folders & files: 
-- ClimbingLizardVideos_2020 (currently in PhD/ClimbingRobot)
     --> within this there are subfolders e.g.: Gecko01, Gecko02, ..., Dragon01 etc.
      which contain subfolders e.g.: video_analysis (contain all videos in .avi format), video_train
-- all force files in.txt format are needed

Run Step1 first, then manual input into the exported dataframes is needed!
Then run Step2! 
If any of the result files of these already exists, the user will be asked if they want to overwrite this.
